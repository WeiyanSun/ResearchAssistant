In this Python script, the following things will be done:

1. find the same words in both CONSIGNEE and SHIPPER name.

2. find whether the SHIPPER address contains several keywords e.g zone, park, etc. 

3. Based on SHIPPER address, find which country it is in (This is mainly done by hard coding. Many addresses donâ€™t contain country directly and only have a city name).
